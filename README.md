# Elemental SQL Implementation

This project encapsulates a command-line Database Management System (DBMS) developed in C++. It offers an interactive interface for users to manipulate databases, tables, and records. The system is designed to interpret and execute SQL-like commands, enabling a comprehensive suite of operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.
<br />


> The primary motivation behind this project was to delve deeper into the intricacies of database systems, with a particular focus on implementing operations like table creation, record insertion and deletion, and data querying.
>
> This project was developed as the [first university assignment](instructions.pdf) for "Practicum of Object-Oriented Programming" at the University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering majoring in Software Engineering. Please refer to the file for detailed assignment instructions.
